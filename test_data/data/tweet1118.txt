@USER @USER @USER The common ground for me is - do unto others as I would have them do unto me . Common courtesy really . Don't force my beliefs on others and would prefer they not ever force theirs onto me . I'm a live and let live , laugh , cherish , joy , share a kind word and warm smile sort ðŸ‡º ðŸ‡¸
