@USER @USER @USER Wrong ! There are things called facts , but you seem to be allergic to them . The Senate heard from 7 witnesses at Judge Nixon ’ s trial who had not testified before the House ; 3 at Clinton ’ s trial ; & 17 at Judge Porteous ’ s trial . I ’ d tell you to read a book , but I doubt you can .
